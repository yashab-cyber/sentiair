uild an Offline AI-Powered Behavioral Threat Detection System for Air-Gapped Systems

Objective:
Develop a cross-platform cybersecurity application named "Sentinair", which provides offline behavioral anomaly detection for air-gapped (non-internet-connected) systems. This app should use machine learning models trained locally to detect suspicious or malicious activities based on usage behavior, system patterns, and device interaction history.

‚úÖ Requirements:
1. Platform Compatibility:
Target OS: Linux (Debian/Kali/Ubuntu), Windows 10+

Must run in completely offline environments

2. Core Features:
‚úÖ Behavioral Tracking Engine:

Monitor:

File access patterns

USB device insertion/removal

Application launch history

System idle/active times

Keystroke and mouse rhythm (not raw capture for privacy)

‚úÖ Local ML Anomaly Detection:

Use unsupervised ML (Isolation Forest / Autoencoders)

Train only on local behavior

Alert on behavior deviation with confidence score

‚úÖ Offline Alerting System:

GUI alerts (pop-up or dashboard)

CLI support for low-resource terminals

Optional email/SMS logs exported manually (no network)

‚úÖ Report Generation:

Generate detailed logs in PDF/CSV

Offline signature scanning support (YARA rules or ClamAV integration)

‚úÖ Stealth Mode (Optional):

Allow the agent to run in hidden/background mode for anti-tampering

Admin unlock with passphrase or USB key

3. Interface:
GUI using PyQt5 or Tkinter (dark mode preferred)

Command-line tool for forensic teams

Dashboard with timeline, graphs, and behavior mapping

4. Security:
No internet calls

No cloud sync

Encrypted local data logs

Self-contained installer

5. Bonus (Advanced):
USB signature DB stored locally (flag unknown devices)

Power fluctuation logging for hardware tampering detection

Rudimentary voice-alert system (offline TTS)

üíª Tech Stack Suggestion:
Python (main code)

Scikit-learn / PyOD for anomaly detection

SQLite or local JSON for behavior storage

PyQt5 or Tkinter for GUI

YARA (optional malware signature engine)

üß† Training/Model Details:
Use local time-series logs of system behavior

Train unsupervised model every 24 hours

Store previous models to compare drift

Flag sudden anomalies: e.g., file access at 3 AM, new app run, long idle + USB use

üõ°Ô∏è Description for Readme or Docs:
Sentinair is an advanced offline AI-based Intrusion Detection System tailored for isolated environments such as air-gapped military, industrial, or banking systems. It watches how a system is normally used and flags anything strange ‚Äî all without needing the internet.
